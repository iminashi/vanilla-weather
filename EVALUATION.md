Evaluating project of Tapio Malmberg

The usability of the app is very good. The app looks pleasant and is easy to use. Refreshing is easy. It is nice that user can add (and delete) cities and they are saved.

The technical features of the app are not simple. The developer must have profound knowledge of Android and Kotlin.

The code is of very good quality and the file structure is reasonable. The variables have propriate names.

The documentation is good and detailed.

The project meets all demands of grade 4: 
- Using RESTful API and device API (location)
- Well commented and documented
- Good usability
